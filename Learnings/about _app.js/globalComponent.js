//this is very crucial to me because this is somethig i have been looking for in my react app and couldnt do still

//but i have been able to do it in my nextjs app
//lets see how !

//first of all we need to talk about the _app.js file
//this file is the main file in nextjs and executes every time a page is loaded/refreshed/changed

//you can check it out by adding a console.log statement in the _app.js file

//so for the a componet to be global it has to be in the _app.js file like navabr

//so lets create a global component
